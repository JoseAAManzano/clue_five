# clue_six

You find yourself in a virtual space. Although it looks entirely familiar, it feels like you had never seen it before. In front of you there is some text. It reads:

"The **fith** number in a picture you will find. To get the **sixth** keep the _beginning_ in mind.

This code will help you find a riddle hidden in plain sight. Download it, run it, and see!"

## We have copied the text from the book for convenience:

You notice an old book that stands out from the rest. You open the book to a folded page, but a part of it doesn’t make sense:

“Caesar liked to play games by shifting letters all over the place. To decipher the message, you need the **sixth** number."

## Hint

You need to find the sixth number by using all previous numbers and completing the sequence. With that number you will be able to reveal the text using some keywords from the book.
